# instabot_using_instapy
Simple program that can follow, like, comment, unfollow on Instagram, automatically!
I used the library InstaPy to create a simple bot that can be operated via your terminal.
The bot is capable of following, liking, commenting, unfollowing, and displaying a list of all the accounts that have unfollowed your account.

This is a project, and is in no way endorsed by Facebook or Instagram. 
DO NOT use this code to increase your Instagram reach as your account will get rate limited, and quite possible, taken down.

Thank you, and enjoy!
